## Introduction

Georeferencing is the process of adding geographic information to a raster (or should I just say image?) (i.e. maps, satelite images and aerial photographs) so mapping software can place the image in its real world location. This is done by assigning geographic coordinates to the raster's pixels. 

## *Georeferencing with ArcPro*

2. Click "Map" under "New Blank Templates".
